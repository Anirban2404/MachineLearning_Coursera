Already, most organizations hoisted their IT infrastructures into some type of cloud: private, public or a hybrid of the two and the numbers are growing. Flexibility, massive scalability, ubiquitous computing with pay-as-you-go facility is few of the vast facilities provided by cloud infrastructure. But IT's history reminds us that no technology can deliver benefits or prosper if the technology isn't harnessed, governed and managed. In this new young world of cloud computing, old-school IT administration and management tools cannot sustain. Management of a cloud infrastructure is becoming a remarkable challenge for IT staffs. Nowadays, the DevOps community provides many tools for the seamless management and orchestration of complex distributes cloud applications. Cloud orchestration tools are used to simplify deployment, management, and monitor cloud resources and processes.  It provides a mechanism to automate the provisioning of various applications and services in the cloud infrastructure as the organization requires. The developer has to make the deployable model in the model-based or script-centric way to take deployment and management benefits of the tools. No doubt it's a much efficient approach than individually install the software components on each machine and configure them. However, there are few challenges lie in this approach. The business application developers need domain expertise, which has a steep learning curve, to make the full-blown deployable model. To eradicate this issue, a modeling environment is needed where the users will be able make their business-relevant model without domain expertise and DSML underneath that will translate the half-baked business model into fully deployable model. Then, the existing cloud automation tools will take the model and deploy, run, and manage the application in the cloud environment. The variety of services offered by the competitive cloud providers have made it difficult for the customers to choose the most appropriate and economical services. To engage intelligent and automated service provisioning, the essential services required by customers, such as availability, flexibility, pricing, security, and other user metrics should be addressed properly. Moreover, complex distributed application can be composite in nature, because of security, efficiency and economic issues. To deploy different application components in different cloud providers, compatibility of different managements APIs, network issues and driver complexities need to be addressed. There exist an OASIS Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standardized way to that allow portability of data and application, and thus eliminate the vendor-locking. However, providing optimal solution along with the correctness, soundness, and completeness of the generated plan is a challenge. Moreover, migrating the cloud application components in a heterogeneous or hybrid cloud environment is required to meet ever-changing business demand. Continuous monitoring and automatic migration based on Policy or Service Level Agreement is required to provide the independent end-to-end cloud automation management solution.  In this paper, we present the key issues in this area and discuss the state-of-the-art methodologies available to tackle these concerns. We conclude the paper with a critical analysis of challenges and highlight directions for future work to guide the next level of preparedness for a looming digitization of the business world.
